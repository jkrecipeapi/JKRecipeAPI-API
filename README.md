Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size. Once risen, punch down the dough, divide it into two balls, and roll out as needed for pizzas.",
